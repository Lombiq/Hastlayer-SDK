; The Default Version Manifest file lists a set of rules that
; are matched against hardware registers and software during version checking.
; Each section (which corresponds to a single rule) must have a unique  
; name followed by key-value pairs. A rule is "compatible" 
; if all of its key-value pairs match against values reported by hardware and software.
; A successful compatibility check occurs when any one of the rules
; are compatible. All rule names must begin with "Rule_". 
;
; The RHS of key-value pairs may be written in hex (prefix with 0x) or in decimal.
; RHS may also use a comma-delimited list. For example, BoardID=0xB0,0xB1
; means that if the BoardID reported by hardware is 0xB0 OR 0xB1, then a compatible
; board was found for a given rule.
;
; RHS values post-fixed with '+' indicate 'greater than or equal'.  For example:
; DriverMinorVer=2+ means that detected values of 2 or greater are compatible.
;
; RHS values post-fixed with '!' suppresses error logging of the entire rule when
; the rule mismatches due to the specific value. Adding '!' has no effect on 
; compatibility checking. If no rules were logged on a compatibility failure,
; the last failing rule is forcibly logged.
