# Hastlayer Algorithms readme



Some useful algorithms that are compatible with Hastlayer and thus can be used in hardware too.

Includes:

- An implementation of the [MWC64X random number generator algorithm](http://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dt10/research/rngs-gpu-mwc64x.htm).
- `Fix64`, a Q31.32 fixed-point number type.
