# Code analysis rules for Hastlayer, extending Lombiq.Analyzers.globalconfig.

# Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers rules

# CA1062: Validate arguments of public methods. We disabled it, because it makes the code bloated and doesn't support
# `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull()` either.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = none

# CA1848: Use the LoggerMessage delegates. While this might slightly improve performance, it deters logging by turning
# it into a huge chore by breaking up the code flow and creating an unreasonable amount of boilerplate.
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1848.severity = none

# CA2007 : Consider calling ConfigureAwait on the awaited task. This warning is relevant to desktop apps that have a GUI
# thread. While Hastlayer can be used in GUI applications, itself does not operate a user interface so this warning is
# not relevant internally. A consumer of the library may call ConfigureAwait on one of the asynchronous public API
# methods if needed.
