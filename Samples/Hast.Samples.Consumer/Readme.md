# Hastlayer consumer sample readme


A simple console application that showcases how an app can utilize Hastlayer. First head to the *Program.cs* file.

This is a complete, thoroughly documented sample. If you'd like to see a more stripped-down version of a minimal Hastlayer-using application, check out the *Hast.Samples.Demo* project instead.

In case you wish to test the ImageProcessingAlgorithms sample with a larger file, the fpga.jpg file must be replaced. You can find a 100 megapixel jpeg [here](https://photographingspace.com/100-megapixel-moon/).
