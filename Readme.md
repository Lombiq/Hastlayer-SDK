# Hastlayer SDK Readme



## Overview

[Hastlayer](https://hastlayer.com/) - be the hardware. Automatically transforming [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/) assemblies into computer chips to improve performance and lower power consumption.

Hastlayer uses [FPGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) (chips that can be "re-wired" on the fly): You just need to select the compute-bound part of your .NET program and Hastlayer will seamlessly swap it out with a generated FPGA implementation. Since not C#, VisualBasic or other code but .NET Intermediate Language assemblies are transformed in theory any .NET language can be used, including C#, VB, F#, C++, Python, PHP, JavaScript...

Hastlayer was also featured on [.NET Conf 2017](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/dotnetConf/2017/T212); the [recorded session](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/dotnetConf/2017/T212) covers most of what's interesting about Hastlayer (it's also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Sq5m3eUSs)). Check out the [FAQ](https://hastlayer.com/faq) for some more basic info.
 
This is the PC-side component of Hastlayer, the one that transforms .NET assemblies, programs attached FPGAs and communicates with said FPGAs.

Created by [Lombiq Technologies](https://lombiq.com/), an open source .NET web development company.

Hastlayer uses [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net/) to process CIL assemblies and [Orchard Application Host](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Application-Host) to utilize [Orchard](http://orchardproject.net/) as the application framework.


## Notes on Hastlayer's documentation

These text files serve as a starting point. The examples are the best source of how to use Hastlayer. Hastlayer's public API is also documented inline as code comments, so if there's anything unclear, check it out. There are further readme documents for these items.
