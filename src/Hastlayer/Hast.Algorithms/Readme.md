# Hastlayer - Algorithms

[![Hast.Algorithms NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Hast.Algorithms?label=Hast.Algorithms)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hast.Algorithms/)

Some useful algorithms that are compatible with Hastlayer and thus can be used in hardware too.

Includes:

- An implementation of the [MWC64X random number generator algorithm](http://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dt10/research/rngs-gpu-mwc64x.htm).
- `Fix64`, a Q31.32 fixed-point number type.
