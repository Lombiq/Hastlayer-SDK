# Benchmarks

Here are some basic performance benchmarks on how Hastlayer-accelerated code compares to standard .NET. Since with FPGAs you're not running a program on a processor like a CPU or GPU but rather you create a processor out of your algorithm direct comparisons are hard. Nevertheless, here we tried to compare FPGAs and host PCs (CPUs) with roughly on the same level (e.g. comparing a mid-tier CPU to a mid-tier FPGA).

## Notes on the benchmarked algorithms

All the algorithms are [samples in the Hastlayer solution](../Samples) and available for you to check.

- [`ImageContrastModifier`](../Samples/Hast.Samples.SampleAssembly/ImageContrastModifier.cs): Algorithm for changing the contrast of an image. It's an archetype of parallelized image processing algorithms, also analogous to other kind of 2D algorithms, e.g. camera images, frames of a video, radar images, particle detector data.
- [`MonteCarloPiEstimator`](../Samples/Hast.Samples.SampleAssembly/MonteCarloPiEstimator.cs): Algorithm to calculate Pi with a random [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) in a parallelized manner. It's an archetype of parallelized Monte Carlo simulations, i.e. simulations that work with random sampling of data. These are used [a variety of applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications).
- [`ParallelAlgorithm`](../Samples/Hast.Samples.SampleAssembly/ParallelAlgorithm.cs): An embarrassingly parallel algorithm that is well suited to be accelerated with Hastlayer. It's an archetype of [embarrassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) algorithms. A [variety of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel#Examples) are in this class.

## Notes on measurements

Here you can find some measurements of execution times of various algorithms on different platforms. Note:

- Measurements were made with binaries built in Release mode.
- Measurements were always taken from the second or third run of the application to disregard initialization time. 
- Figures are rounded to the nearest integer.
- Speed and power advantage means the execution time and power consumption advantage of the Hastlayer-accelerated FPGA implementation. This is calculated as follows: `(CPU value/FPGA value-1)*100`. E.g. a 100% speed advantage means that the Hastlayer-accelerated implementation took half the time to finish than the original CPU one, and a 900% speed advantage means that if the original implementation took 100 ms then the FPGA one 10 ms.
- Degree of parallelism indicates the level of parallelization in the algorithm (typically the number of concurrent `Task`s). For details on these check out the source of the respective algorithm (these are all classes in the Hastlayer SDK's solution). Note that the degree of parallelism, as indicated, differs between platforms. On every platform the highest possible parallelism was used (so CPUs were under full load and thus peak power consumption can be reasonably assumed).
- For CPU execution always the lowest achieved number is used to disregard noise. So this is an optimistic approach and in real life the CPU executions will most possibly be slower.
- Power consumption is an approximation based on hardware details. For PCs it only contains the power consumption of the CPU(s). For FPGA measurements the "total" time is used (though presumably when just communication is running the power consumption is much lower than when computations are being executed).
- FPGA resource utilization figures are based on the "main" resource's utilization with all other resource types assumed to be below 100%. For Xilinx FPGAs the main resource type is LUT, for Intel (Altera) ones ALM.
- For FPGA measurements "total" means the total execution time, including the communication latency of the FPGA; since this varies because of the host PC's load the lowest achieved number is used. "Net" means just the execution of the algorithm itself on the FPGA, not including the time it took to send data to and receive from the device; FPGA execution time is deterministic and doesn't vary significantly. With faster communication channels "total" can be closer to "net". If the input and output data is small then the two measurements will practically be the same.

## Vitis

Comparing the performance of a Vitis platform FPGA (Xilinx Alveo U280/250/200/50) to the host PC's performance on a [Nimbix](https://www.nimbix.net/alveo) instance.

### Details

- FPGA: The following [Xilinx Vitis Unified Software Platform](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-platform.html) cards were used:
  - [Alveo U280 Data Center Accelerator Card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html), PCI Express速 Gen3 x16, 225 W Maximum Total Power
  - [Alveo U250 Data Center Accelerator Card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html), PCI Express速 Gen3 x16, 225 W Maximum Total Power
  - [Alveo U200 Data Center Accelerator Card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html), PCI Express速 Gen3 x16, 225 W Maximum Total Power
  - [Alveo U50 Data Center Accelerator Card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html), PCI Express速 Gen3 x16, 75 W Maximum Total Power
- Host: A [Nimbix](https://www.nimbix.net/alveo) "Xilinx Vitis Unified Software Platform 2020.1" instance with 16 x Intel Xeon E5-2640 v3 CPUs with 8 physical, 16 logical cores each, with a base clock of 2.6 GHz. Power consumption is around 90 W under load (based on the processor's TDP, [see here](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/83359/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2640-v3-20m-cache-2-60-ghz.html); the power draw is likely larger when the CPU increases its clock speed under load).
- Only a single CPU is assumed to be running under 100% load for the power usage figures for the sake of simplicity. The table has a matching [Excel sheet](Attachments/Vitis%20benchmark.xlsx) that was converted using [this VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csholmq.excel-to-markdown-table).
- The kernels were built on the initial 2019.2 version of the Vitis Unified Software Platform. We have seen in one case 20% improvement in frequency (leading to shorter run times and lower total power consumption) by compiling with the newer 2020.1 version.

1. Using the default 0.2MP image `fpga.jpg`.
2. Using the larger [73.2MP image](https://photographingspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019JulyLunarEclipse-Moon0655-CorySchmitz-PI2_wm-web.jpg).
3. Using the scaled down [6.4MP image](https://photographingspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019JulyLunarEclipse-Moon0655-CorySchmitz-PI2_wm-web50pct-square-scaled.jpg) because the testing binary was built for the High Bandwidth Memory. Currently only one HBM slot is supported, meaning that the available memory without disabling HBM is 256MB.
4. The same applies from the previous point, with the added limitation that the Alveo U50 card doesn't have any DDR memory, so using HBM is the only option.
5. This device and sample was too fast to produce measurable times on the default 0.2MP image so it was skipped. 

We used the following shell function to test: 
```shell
function benchmark() {
	name=$1
	sample=$2
	device=$3

	echo -e "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$name"
	dotnet Hast.Samples.Consumer.dll -sample $sample -device "$device" -name "$name" > /dev/null
	dotnet Hast.Samples.Consumer.dll -sample $sample -device "$device" -name "$name" > /dev/null
	dotnet Hast.Samples.Consumer.dll -sample $sample -device "$device" -name "$name"
}
```

Inside the Hast.Samples.Consumer binary's directory, while assuming that the larger image is in the home as `moon.jpg`.
```shell
benchmark image ImageProcessingAlgorithms ImageContrastModifier > run.log
benchmark parallel ParallelAlgorithm ParallelAlgorithm >> run.log
benchmark monte MonteCarloPiEstimator MonteCarloPiEstimator >> run.log

cp ~/moon.jpg fpga.jpg
benchmark image ImageProcessingAlgorithms ImageContrastModifier > run.moon.log
```

The utilization and power usage information was inside the *HardwareFramework/reports* directory.

- Host: [ARM dual-core Cortex-A9 MPCore APU with a base clock of 667 MHz.](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds190-Zynq-7000-Overview.pdf)
- Both have access to 1 GB (32-bit) DDR3L SDRAM.
- Trenz reported the typical power consumption as about 5W. Using an inline mains energy meter we've measured 4.6W minimum. The numbers in the table below show the measured maximums. Two separate builds were repeatedly executed in a loops during measurement. One build only executed the CPU version, while the other only the FPGA version.
- The script _[zynq-benchmark.dot.sh](../Hast.Abstractions/Hast.Vitis.Abstractions/Docs/Attachments/zynq-benchmark.dot.sh)_ with helpful functions used for the benchmarking is attached. The _dot_ in the name indicates that it should be sourced with the [dot command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_(command)) in Bash.

1. Total system watts with CPU payload.
2. Total system watts with FPGA payload.
3. Peak for this device, both 賊10 parallelism resulted in very slight performance degradation with very similar extent. 
4. Near peak. Perhaps it could be further adjusted to squeeze out 1-2 ms, but the returns are very diminishing. We've also tried +30 parallelism but that displayed drastic performance degradation (50-52ms compared to 30-36ms with all lower values).
5. The xclbin build takes a very long time and ultimately crashes when parallelism is 290 or higher.

Main clock is 150 Mhz, power consumption is at most 29 W (source: "[A Cloud-Scale Acceleration Architecture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cloud-Scale-Acceleration-Architecture.pdf)").
- Host: 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2450 CPUs with 16 physical, 32 logical cores each, with a base clock of 2.1 GHz. Power consumption is around 95 W under load (based on the processor's TDP, [see here](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/64611/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2450-20m-cache-2-10-ghz-8-00-gt-s-intel-qpi.html); the power draw is likely larger when the CPU increases its clock speed under load).
- Only a single CPU is assumed to be running under 100% load for the power usage figures for the sake of simplicity.

## Nexys

Comparing the performance of the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board to a host PC with an Intel Core i7-960 CPU.

### Details

- FPGA: [Nexys A7-100T FPGA board](https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/) with a Xilinx XC7A100T-1CSG324C FPGA of the Artix-7 family, with 110 MB of user-accessible DDR2 RAM. Main clock is 100 Mhz, power consumption is at most about 2.5 W (corresponding to the maximal power draw via a USB 2.0 port). The communication channel used was the serial one: Virtual serial port via USB 2.0 with a baud rate of 230400 b/s.
- Host: Intel Core i7-960 CPU with 4 physical, 8 logical cores and a base clock of 3.2 Ghz. Power consumption is around 130 W under load (based on [the processor's TDP](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/37151/intel-core-i7-960-processor-8m-cache-3-20-ghz-4-80-gt-s-intel-qpi.html); the power draw is likely larger when the CPU increases its clock speed under load).
- Vivado and Xilinx SDK 2016.4 were used.

1. The low degree of parallelism available due to the resource constraints of the FPGA coupled with the slow serial connection makes this sample worse than on the CPU. Due to data transfer using only a fraction of the resources compared to doing the actual computations the power advantage of the FPGA implementation is most possibly closer to +4700%.
2. With a degree of parallelism of 79 the FPGA resource utilization would jump to 101% so this is the limit of efficiency.
3. With a degree of parallelism of 270 the resource utilization goes above 90% (94% post-synthesis) and the implementation step of bitstream generation fails.

## Further data

- In the ["High-level .NET Software Implementations of Unum Type I and Posit with Simultaneous FPGA Implementation Using Hastlayer" whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N659104) presented at the CoNGA 2018 conference the performance and clock cycle efficiency (which can be roughly equated to power efficiency) of operations of the posit floating point number format are compared. While the FPGA implementation is about 10x slower it's about 2-3x more power efficient.
- While details can't be disclosed an Italian company observed a 10x speed increase of various high-frequency trading algorithms, compared to the original C++ implementation.
