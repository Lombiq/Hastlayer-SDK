# Hastlayer roadmap



Everything is about allowing software engineers to make their programs faster easily by leveraging the power of FPGAs. You can get an up-to-date glimpse of what's in focus from the [issues](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-SDK/issues) and the [project cards](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-SDK/projects/1). Feel free to open issues yourself for bug reports and feature requests!

On a high level this is what we have outlined for the future:

1. Find partners for field testing and test applications that can be compared with other implementations. We need results that can be showcased.
2. Implement floating point support with [Posits](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-SDK/issues/21), a better version of the usual `float`s and `double`s.
3. Implement support for more cloud FPGAs.
